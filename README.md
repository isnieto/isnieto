Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Ismael Nieto, a passionate technophile and a dedicated problem solver. I'm always in update-mode, eager to learn new things every single day. I believe in the power of positivity and carry an insatiable willingness to learn.

My interests are broad, but recently, I've been very intrigued by DevOps, Kubernetes (K8s), and Python. I see these as powerful tools that can revolutionize the way we develop and deliver software. I'm currently working on applications using Argo, Helm, and Docker, and I'm also learning Go.

You can check out all of my projects at my portfolio. If you want to reach out, feel free to email me at ismael.nieto@gmail.com.

Fun fact about me: I'm a Sea Buoy hunter! ðŸŒŠ

Looking forward to connecting with you and exploring the endless possibilities in the world of tech!
